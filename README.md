# Smart-Door-Locking-System
Abstract
The proposed project is to develop an IoT based Locking cum attendance device for security purpose of different places like office, schools, hotels etc. In our system, the employee initially can log on the offices utilities with the help of the unique ID provided to him. After the initial log entry with the employee ID’s unique code to the company application he/she will receive a QR code or OTP code through which they can open the door and mark there attendance. Our proposed system also helps the employee to see their meeting timings and scheduled meeting using the application . So, by developing this android application our main aim is to focus on the security door lock through which every entry can be taken and can be recorded.

1.	Introduction

Our idea is based on security lock in which we are using IOT based device for machine work and android Software to develop an android application through which the user get the code and the details of the door lock in the form of OTP and he/she have to the enter that unique code in the 4*4 universal 16 key matrix membrane keypad as user will get the output on the screen for entering the code!

After the person enter the code it will directly reach to the machine (Arduino). 

In our app we will having a login/Signup page for the user and then we will be showing all code and office updates to the employee. We will list all the item and door codes present in the office like we can have separate locks in separate room or cabins. Then we will try to create a payment for doing the payment in the application for tea, snacks etc. All the required will be codded using C language which will be connected to our android application.

So, by developing this android application our main aim is to digitalize and a secured looking device without any finger print or any face scanning issue!

2. Literature Survey

There are several devices available in the Market but that is not affordable and cost effective. There are several IOT based locked but there is no lock device which help the employees to mark there attendance to assign them the work to schedule the meetings and also no device is available which contains a double security locker. 
Different types of lock device are available like steel lock with key, code lock, finger print lock, face scanner lock, Android app lock but no lock is available for scheduling and assigning the work with lock opening. 
Security- There can be endless security in this device as it need 3 verification which is by phone, code and OTP.

2.	Existing systems
There is very high tech security system Is commercial place and the bank which a common man cannot afford. Also ,the normal lock and key method are not enough because it can be easily breakable with low noise.

3.	Objectives
IOT based security entryway lock which is utilized for up-and-comer participation update and to open the entryway using competitor one of a kind OTP code and it can likewise help for telling the representative work refreshed and the gathering time which is planned before with the participation. Assist the organization with getting a gotten OTP key for each representative effectively and furthermore to outlined scheduled

4.	Methodology
We will be using Arduino and its some other components like buzzer, key lock (to enter the pass), Motor to extract the current from adaptor and Implement on the door lock. As we have also worked on the modern app on which employees can find all the details of the meeting scheduled in the day, the security code the Payment method for all the snacks, drinks, and rest all payments in the office, for the attendance purpose and main for unlocking the door.

•	Planning → To identify all the information and requirement such as hardware and software, planning must be done in the proper manner. The planning phase have two main elements namely data collection and the requirements of hardware tools like Arduino and software here we will do Android and Using C programming language Arduino.
•	Data collection → Data collection is a stage in any area of study. At this stage we planned about the project’s resources and requirements, literature studies and schedule to get more information in this study. All the materials are collected from journal, texts book and research papers gathered from libraries and Internet.
•	System & software feasibility study → Developers need to discuss and study weather this type of software could be formed or not hence at last of this phase a rough picture of the project will be in mind of every participant .
•	Requirement Analysis & Gathering → Gather all resources and knowledge about project such as C-compiler , Android , https://www.tinkercad.com/ Etc .
•	Design → Designers will use Blender android and canva to design the flow of work in software also it could be manipulated as work processes. Here different phases of the project will be represented in form of individual device like buzzer, :2 Channel Relay Board 5V :12V Solenoid Lock: IR Proximity Sensor; 12V Power or Battery: 7805 Regulator: 16v 100uf Capacitor: Push Button Bell or buzzer: LED: OLED Display: Resistor 1k ohms:  Bread Board: Wires.
•	Coding →Developers will then start the coding process in C language where they will code for making an android application with Android.
•	Testing → Here Development process UNIT TESTING will be performed after every unit is completed and also INTEGRATION TESTING at the time of integration. At end when all components are together testers will perform SYSTEM TESTING. 
•	Operations→ The software is ready with all features working and also for user interaction here with deployment tool it could even be deployed in any environment.
